# 🚨 URGENT: Fix EU AI Act Webhook - Missing Secret

## 🎯 **Your Issue**
Your conversation correctly detected **"social scoring system"** as PROHIBITED, but no final assessment appeared because the webhook secret is missing.

## ✅ **2-Minute Fix**

### **Step 1: Get Webhook Secret from ElevenLabs**
1. **Go to**: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. **Navigate to your agent settings**
3. **Find**: "Webhooks" or "Post-call webhook" section
4. **Click**: "Add Webhook" or "Configure Webhook"
5. **Enter URL**:
   ```
   https://ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn.supabase.co/functions/v1/elevenlabs-webhook
   ```
6. **CRITICAL - Select this event**:
   - ✅ `conversation.ended` (This triggers EU AI Act analysis)
7. **Copy the generated secret** (looks like: `whsec_abc123...`)

### **Step 2: Add Secret to Supabase**
1. **Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn
2. **Navigate to**: Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
3. **Click**: "Add new secret"
4. **Add**:
   ```
   Name: ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   Value: [paste the secret from ElevenLabs]
   ```
5. **Save**

### **Step 3: Test EU AI Act Assessment**
1. **Start new conversation**
2. **Say**: "I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"
3. **End conversation** (red phone button)
4. **Watch for**: PROHIBITED (95) in top bar + red notification

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **For "social scoring system":**
- **Top Bar**: `PROHIBITED (95)` 🚫
- **Notification**: Red popup with "PROHIBITED AI System Detected!"
- **Dashboard**: New assessment with EU compliance requirements
- **Console**: Complete EU AI Act analysis logs

### **Console Logs You Should See:**
```
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT WEBHOOK REQUEST: { method: "POST", ... }
🎯 EU AI ACT MATCH - PROHIBITED: { matched: ["social scoring"], score: 95 }
🚫 EU AI ACT PROHIBITED - Prohibited AI system detected
✅ EU AI ACT DATABASE SUCCESS - Risk assessment stored
🚨🇪🇺 EU AI ACT HIGH RISK ALERT 🇪🇺🚨
```

## 🧪 **More Test Phrases**

### **🚫 PROHIBITED (Should show red notification):**
```
"I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"
"My AI does mass surveillance of the population"
"We use real-time biometric identification in public spaces"
```

### **⚠️ HIGH-RISK (Should show orange notification):**
```
"I have an AI system for recruitment and hiring decisions"
"My AI evaluates students in educational settings"
"We use AI for credit scoring and loan approvals"
```

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

1. **Real-time detection works** ✅ (Your app detects keywords during conversation)
2. **Agent responds correctly** ✅ (ElevenLabs identifies the risk)
3. **Webhook missing** ❌ (Final analysis needs webhook configuration)
4. **No database storage** ❌ (Without webhook, no assessment is saved)

## 🎊 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Top bar shows "PROHIBITED (95)" instead of "Risk Assessment Pending"
- ✅ Red notification popup appears
- ✅ Dashboard shows new EU AI Act assessment
- ✅ Console shows complete webhook processing logs

**Your phrase "social scoring system" should trigger PROHIBITED status because social scoring is explicitly banned under EU AI Act Article 5!** 🇪🇺🚫

**Once configured, your EU AI Act compliance system will be fully functional!** 🚀✨
