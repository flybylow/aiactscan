# 🔧 Fix Missing Webhook Data - EU AI Act Setup

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
Your conversation ended but no EU AI Act assessment appeared because the webhook secret is not configured.

## ✅ **Quick Fix Steps**

### **Step 1: Configure Webhook Secret in Supabase**
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn`
3. Navigate to **Edge Functions** → **Secrets**
4. Click **"Add new secret"**
5. Add:
   ```
   Name: ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   Value: [Get this from ElevenLabs in Step 2]
   ```

### **Step 2: Configure ElevenLabs Webhook**
1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Navigate to your agent settings
3. Find the **"Webhooks"** or **"Post-call webhook"** section
4. Click **"Add Webhook"** or **"Configure Webhook"**
5. Enter webhook URL:
   ```
   https://ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn.supabase.co/functions/v1/elevenlabs-webhook
   ```
6. **CRITICAL:** Select these events:
   - ✅ `conversation.ended` (This triggers EU AI Act analysis)
   - ✅ `user.message` (Optional for real-time monitoring)
   - ✅ `agent.response` (Optional for real-time monitoring)

7. **Copy the generated secret** and go back to Supabase
8. **Paste the secret** as the value for `ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
9. **Save** the secret in Supabase

### **Step 3: Test EU AI Act Assessment**
1. Start a new conversation
2. Say: **"I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"**
3. **End the conversation** (click red phone button)
4. Watch for webhook processing in console
5. Check top bar for EU AI Act risk category

## 🎯 **Expected EU AI Act Results**

### **For "social scoring system":**
- **Category:** PROHIBITED 🚫
- **Score:** 90+ 
- **Status:** Banned under EU AI Act
- **Notification:** Red popup with prohibition notice
- **Top Bar:** Shows "PROHIBITED (95)" or similar

### **Console Logs You Should See:**
```
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT WEBHOOK REQUEST: { method: "POST", ... }
🎯 EU AI ACT WEBHOOK PAYLOAD PARSED: { event_type: "conversation.ended", ... }
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT ANALYSIS - Starting comprehensive risk assessment...
🎯 EU AI ACT MATCH - PROHIBITED: { matched: ["social scoring"], count: 1, weight: 100 }
🚫 EU AI ACT PROHIBITED - Prohibited AI system detected: ["social scoring"]
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT ANALYSIS COMPLETE: { level: "prohibited", score: 95, category: "prohibited" }
✅ EU AI ACT DATABASE SUCCESS - Risk assessment stored
🚨🇪🇺 EU AI ACT HIGH RISK ALERT 🇪🇺🚨
```

## 🧪 **More Test Phrases**

### **🚫 PROHIBITED (Should trigger immediate ban):**
```
"I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"
"My AI does mass surveillance of the population"
"We use real-time biometric identification in public spaces"
"Our system uses subliminal techniques to manipulate behavior"
```

### **⚠️ HIGH-RISK (Should trigger strict compliance):**
```
"I have an AI system for recruitment and hiring decisions"
"My AI evaluates students in educational settings"
"We use AI for credit scoring and loan approvals"
"Our system provides medical diagnosis recommendations"
```

### **📋 LIMITED RISK (Should trigger transparency obligations):**
```
"I have a chatbot that interacts with customers"
"My AI generates deepfake content"
"We use AI for content recommendation systems"
```

### **✅ MINIMAL RISK (Should show no specific obligations):**
```
"I have a spam filter for emails"
"My AI does language translation"
"We use AI for data analysis and pattern recognition"
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Still no webhook data?**
1. **Check ElevenLabs webhook events** - make sure `conversation.ended` is selected
2. **Verify webhook secret** - copy exactly from ElevenLabs to Supabase
3. **Test endpoint** - use the "Test Endpoint" button in Webhook Setup
4. **Check Supabase logs** - Edge Functions → elevenlabs-webhook → Logs

### **Wrong risk category?**
1. **Use more explicit phrases** - include exact EU AI Act keywords
2. **Check keyword matches** in console logs
3. **Try different risk categories** to verify system is working

## 🎊 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Top bar shows EU AI Act categories (PROHIBITED, HIGH-RISK, etc.)
- ✅ Notifications appear with EU compliance information
- ✅ Dashboard shows compliance requirements
- ✅ Console shows EU AI Act analysis logs

**Once configured, your system will provide real-time EU AI Act compliance assessment!** 🇪🇺🚀
