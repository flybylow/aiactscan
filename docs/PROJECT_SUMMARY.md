# 🇪🇺 AI Act Scan - Project Summary & Development History

## 📋 Project Overview

**AI Act Scan** is a production-ready web application that provides real-time EU AI Act compliance assessment for AI systems. Users describe their AI systems via voice or text, and the application analyzes the conversation to determine risk levels, compliance requirements, and regulatory obligations under the EU AI Act.

### 🎯 Core Functionality

    conversation_id text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    agent_id text NOT NULL,
    risk_level text NOT NULL CHECK (risk_level IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')),
    risk_score integer CHECK (risk_score >= 0 AND risk_score <= 100),
    risk_factors jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
    conversation_summary text,
    detected_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
  );
  ```
- Implemented Row Level Security with proper policies

**Solutions:**
- Built comprehensive admin panel with multiple tabs:
  - **System Status**: Environment variables and webhook configuration
  - **Setup Guide**: Step-by-step configuration instructions
  - **Testing Tools**: Webhook testing and data simulation
  - **Database Tests**: Health checks and connectivity verification
  - **Live Chat**: Real-time analysis logs and monitoring
- Created simulation tools for testing without actual ElevenLabs calls
- Implemented real-time log aggregation and filtering

## 🔧 Key Technical Solutions

### 1. Webhook Architecture
```typescript
// Comprehensive webhook processing with EU AI Act analysis
function analyzeEUAIActRisk(callData: any): {
  risk_level: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  risk_score: number;
  risk_factors: Record<string, any>;
  eu_assessment: {
    category: string;
    label: string;
    description: string;
    compliance_requirements: string[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Real-time State Management
```typescript
// Real-time risk assessment updates
const { riskAssessments, loading, isUpdating, fetchRiskAssessments } = useRiskAssessments();

// Webhook event handling
useEffect(() => {
  const handleRiskDetected = (event: CustomEvent) => {
    const riskAssessment = event.detail;
    setCurrentRiskAssessment(riskAssessment);
    setRealTimeRiskLevel(riskAssessment.risk_level);
    setRealTimeRiskScore(riskAssessment.risk_score);
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('riskDetected', handleRiskDetected);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('riskDetected', handleRiskDetected);
}, []);
```

## 🚨 Major Obstacles & How We Solved Them

### Obstacle 1: ElevenLabs Webhook Configuration Complexity
**Problem:** Users consistently struggled with webhook setup, leading to no risk assessments appearing.

**Root Cause:** ElevenLabs webhooks are opt-in and require specific event selection.

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive setup guides in `docs/` folder
- Built webhook status checker in admin panel
- Implemented clear error messages and troubleshooting steps
- Added simulation tools for testing without webhook dependency

### Obstacle 2: Database Enum vs Text Value Mismatch
**Problem:** Database used enum values but webhook functions expected different text values.

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent data types between database schema and application logic.

**Solution:**
- Standardized on text values throughout the application
- Updated database schema to use text with CHECK constraints
- Maintained backward compatibility during migration
- Created clear mapping between database values and UI display

### Obstacle 3: Real-time vs Post-call Analysis Strategy
**Problem:** Deciding between real-time message analysis vs comprehensive post-call analysis.

**Root Cause:** ElevenLabs real-time events are limited; post-call provides complete context.

**Solution:**
- Implemented hybrid approach:
  - Real-time keyword detection for immediate feedback
  - Post-call comprehensive analysis for final assessment
  - Fallback local analysis if webhook fails
- Created clear user feedback for both modes

### Obstacle 4: Complex UI State Management
**Problem:** Managing multiple states (connection, risk assessment, notifications, modals).

**Root Cause:** Complex interaction between ElevenLabs SDK, webhook events, and UI updates.

**Solution:**
- Implemented centralized state management in main App component
- Created custom hooks for specific data domains
- Used event-driven architecture for webhook communication
- Built comprehensive logging for debugging state issues

### Obstacle 5: Production Deployment & Environment Configuration
**Problem:** Complex setup process with multiple services and environment variables.

**Root Cause:** Integration between ElevenLabs, Supabase, and custom webhook processing.

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive documentation with step-by-step guides
- Built environment variable validation and status checking
- Implemented admin panel for configuration verification
- Created automated testing tools for deployment validation
