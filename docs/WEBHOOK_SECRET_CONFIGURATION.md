# 🔧 Fix EU AI Act Webhook - No Risk Assessment Data

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
Your conversation correctly detected **PROHIBITED** EU AI Act keywords, but no final risk assessment appeared because the webhook secret is missing.

## ✅ **Quick Fix Steps**

### **Step 1: Configure Webhook Secret in Supabase**
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn`
3. **Navigate to**: Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
4. **Click**: "Add new secret"
5. **Add**:
   ```
   Name: ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   Value: [Get this from ElevenLabs in Step 2]
   ```

### **Step 2: Configure ElevenLabs Webhook**
1. **Go to**: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. **Navigate to your agent settings**
3. **Find**: "Webhooks" or "Post-call webhook" section
4. **Click**: "Add Webhook" or "Configure Webhook"
5. **Enter webhook URL**:
   ```
   https://ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn.supabase.co/functions/v1/elevenlabs-webhook
   ```
6. **CRITICAL - Select this event**:
   - ✅ `conversation.ended` (This triggers the final EU AI Act analysis)

7. **Copy the generated secret** from ElevenLabs
8. **Go back to Supabase** and paste it as the value for `ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
9. **Save** the secret

### **Step 3: Test EU AI Act Assessment**
1. **Start a new conversation**
2. **Say**: "I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"
3. **IMPORTANT**: **End the conversation** (click red phone button)
4. **Watch for**:
   - Console logs showing webhook processing
   - Top bar changing to "PROHIBITED (95)"
   - Red notification popup
   - Dashboard update

## 🎯 **Expected Results for "Social Scoring System"**

### **Top Bar Should Show**:
```
PROHIBITED (95) 🚫
```

### **Notification Should Appear**:
```
🚫 PROHIBITED AI System Detected!
EU AI Act Risk Score: 95/100
This AI system is prohibited under EU AI Act
```

### **Console Logs Should Show**:
```
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT WEBHOOK REQUEST: { method: "POST", ... }
🎯 EU AI ACT WEBHOOK PAYLOAD PARSED: { event_type: "conversation.ended", ... }
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT ANALYSIS - Starting comprehensive risk assessment...
🎯 EU AI ACT MATCH - PROHIBITED: { matched: ["social scoring"], count: 1, weight: 100 }
🚫 EU AI ACT PROHIBITED - Prohibited AI system detected: ["social scoring"]
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT ANALYSIS COMPLETE: { level: "prohibited", score: 95 }
✅ EU AI ACT DATABASE SUCCESS - Risk assessment stored
🚨🇪🇺 EU AI ACT HIGH RISK ALERT 🇪🇺🚨
```

## 🧪 **More Test Phrases**

### **🚫 PROHIBITED (Score 90+)**
```
"I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"
"My AI does mass surveillance of the population"  
"We use real-time biometric identification in public spaces"
"Our system uses subliminal techniques to manipulate behavior"
```

### **⚠️ HIGH-RISK (Score 60-89)**
```
"I have an AI system for recruitment and hiring decisions"
"My AI evaluates students in educational settings"
"We use AI for credit scoring and loan approvals"
"Our system provides medical diagnosis recommendations"
```

### **📋 LIMITED RISK (Score 25-59)**
```
"I have a chatbot that interacts with customers"
"My AI generates deepfake content"
"We use AI for content recommendation systems"
```

### **✅ MINIMAL RISK (Score 0-24)**
```
"I have a spam filter for emails"
"My AI does language translation"
"We use AI for data analysis and pattern recognition"
```

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

1. **Real-time detection works**: Your app detects EU keywords during conversation
2. **Agent responds correctly**: ElevenLabs agent identifies the risk level
3. **Webhook missing**: Final comprehensive analysis requires webhook configuration
4. **No database storage**: Without webhook, no risk assessment is saved or displayed

## 🎊 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ **Top bar updates**: Shows EU AI Act categories (PROHIBITED, HIGH-RISK, etc.)
- ✅ **Notifications appear**: With EU compliance information and risk scores
- ✅ **Dashboard updates**: Shows new assessments with compliance requirements
- ✅ **Console shows**: Complete EU AI Act analysis logs

## 📞 **Quick Test**

**Say this exact phrase**:
> "I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"

**Expected result**:
- PROHIBITED category (score 95+)
- Red notification popup
- Top bar shows "PROHIBITED (95)"
- Console shows complete EU AI Act analysis

**Your EU AI Act compliance system will be fully functional once the webhook secret is configured!** 🇪🇺🚀✨
