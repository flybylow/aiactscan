# 🚨 Fix ElevenLabs Webhook - No Data Received

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**
Your conversation ended but no webhook data was received because ElevenLabs webhook events are not configured.

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Configure ElevenLabs Webhook**
1. **Go to ElevenLabs Dashboard**: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. **Select your agent** (the one you're using in the app)
3. **Find "Webhooks" section** (might be under Settings or Advanced)
4. **Click "Add Webhook" or "Configure Webhook"**

### **Step 2: Add Webhook URL**
```
Webhook URL: https://ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn.supabase.co/functions/v1/elevenlabs-webhook
```

### **Step 3: CRITICAL - Select Events**
**You MUST select these events for the webhook to work:**

✅ **Required Events:**
- `conversation.ended` (Most important - triggers final analysis)
- `call.analysis_complete` (If available)
- `post_call_analysis` (If available)

❌ **Don't rely on these (may not be available):**
- `user.message` (Often not available in real-time)
- `agent.response` (Often not available in real-time)

### **Step 4: Get Webhook Secret**
1. **Copy the generated secret** from ElevenLabs (looks like: `whsec_abc123...`)
2. **Go to Supabase**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ktmxfobpnvbrcxdiqjfn
3. **Navigate to**: Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
4. **Add secret**:
   ```
   Name: ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   Value: [paste the secret from ElevenLabs]
   ```
5. **Save**

### **Step 5: Test the Configuration**
1. **Start a new conversation**
2. **Say**: "I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"
3. **End the conversation** (click red phone button)
4. **Watch for webhook logs** in browser console

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Console Logs You Should See:**
```
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT WEBHOOK REQUEST: { method: "POST", ... }
🎯 EU AI ACT WEBHOOK PAYLOAD PARSED: { event_type: "conversation.ended", ... }
🇪🇺 EU AI ACT ANALYSIS - Starting comprehensive risk assessment...
🎯 EU AI ACT MATCH - PROHIBITED: { matched: ["social scoring"], score: 95 }
🚫 EU AI ACT PROHIBITED - Prohibited AI system detected
✅ EU AI ACT DATABASE SUCCESS - Risk assessment stored
🚨🇪🇺 EU AI ACT HIGH RISK ALERT 🇪🇺🚨
```

### **UI Changes You Should See:**
- **Top bar**: Changes from "Risk: Pending" to "PROHIBITED (95)"
- **Notification**: Red popup appears with "PROHIBITED AI System Detected!"
- **Dashboard**: New assessment appears with EU compliance requirements

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

ElevenLabs webhooks are **opt-in** - they don't send data automatically. You must:
1. **Configure the webhook URL** in your agent settings
2. **Select specific events** to trigger webhooks
3. **Configure the shared secret** for security

## 🧪 **Test Phrases After Fix**

### **🚫 PROHIBITED (Should trigger red alert):**
```
"I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"
"My AI does mass surveillance of the population"
"We use real-time biometric identification in public spaces"
```

### **⚠️ HIGH-RISK (Should trigger orange alert):**
```
"I have an AI system for recruitment and hiring decisions"
"My AI evaluates students in educational settings"
"We use AI for credit scoring and loan approvals"
```

## 🎊 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Console shows webhook request logs
- ✅ Top bar shows EU AI Act categories instead of "Risk: Pending"
- ✅ Notifications appear for high-risk systems
- ✅ Dashboard shows new assessments with compliance requirements

## 📞 **Quick Test**

**After configuration, test with:**
> "I have a social scoring system that rates citizens"

**Expected result:**
- PROHIBITED category (score 95+)
- Red notification popup
- Console shows complete webhook processing
- Dashboard shows new EU AI Act assessment

**Your system is ready - it just needs ElevenLabs to send the webhook data!** 🚀✨
